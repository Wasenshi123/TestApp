# TestApp
This is an application for testing, trying to finish 2 functionalities within limited time frame. (2 hours)

Ultimately, I used around 2-3 hours to finish all 2 functionalities, as you can see the evidence from commit log.
(Excluding time used to comprehend the requirements and time that wasn't used to code or away from keyboard, etc.)

### Time Used Digestion
12.00 - 13.00 : try to understand the problems and requirements. Also need to analyse the approach and scope of the test. (should I create UI? it needs me to do input managing or any UI at all? or just simple function with input/output? What about error or input managing?)

13.00 - 14.00 : Actually started coding the skeleton and rough concept/logic of 2 functionalities. ( 1 hour)

14.00 - 15.15 : Stop coding and away from keyboard, knowing that the time is out.

15.15 - 15.42 : Back to coding, thinking that at least I will try to finish it, regarding the tester would accept it or not. (~ 30 minutes)

15.42 - 24.00 : Went out from home (party with friends) got home almost midnight.

24.00 - 24.32 : Continued coding and finished the second functionality (Formula calculation) (32 minutes)

24.32 - 8.00 : Sleep

8.00 - 8.30 : Wake up and take a shower

8.30 - 9.01 : Organized the code and manage input (31 minutes)

9.01 - 9.23 : Finished the first functionalities (Bingo Game) (22 minutes)

**Accumulation : 1h + 30m + 32m + 31m + 22m = ~ 2 hours and 53 minutes
